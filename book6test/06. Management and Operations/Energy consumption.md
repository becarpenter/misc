## Energy consumption

There is no firm evidence whether IPv6 has net energy consumption
greater or less than IPv4 for the same application layer traffic load.
There are factors that might work in favour of IPv6, such as a larger
minimum PDU size or less energy spent on network address translation,
and factors that might work against it, such as the transmission time
for longer packet headers or greater use of link-local multicast.
Equally, there is no evidence whether different co-existence strategies
(e.g., native dual stack versus IPv4-as-a-service) have significantly
different energy costs.

[BCP 202](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp202) makes specific
recommendations on reducing the energy consumption of IPv6 Router
Advertisements.

It is worth noting that in the area of constrained IPv6 nodes with very
limited battery power and transmission capacity
\[[RFC8376](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8376)\], considerable
attention has been paid to energy consumption, including compression
mechanisms such as Generic Framework for Static Context Header
Compression and Fragmentation (SCHC)
\[[RFC8724](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8724)\].

# book6 Code of Conduct

Participants are people who contribute to this GitHub
repository, or who create or comment on issues or discussions.

Participants extend respect and courtesy to their colleagues
at all times; treat other participants as you would like to be treated.

Participants have impersonal discussions. We dispute ideas by
using reasoned argument rather than through strong language,
intimidation, or personal attack. We document solutions for
the global IPv6 Internet that meet the needs of diverse
technical and operational environments.

We use our engineering judgment to describe the best
solutions for the whole IPv6 Internet, not just the best solution
for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user.

_This code of conduct was inspired by RFC 7154._

The editorial team reserves the right to moderate or block
inappropriate behavior by participants.

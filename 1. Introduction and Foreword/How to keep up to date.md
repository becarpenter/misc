# How to keep up to date

The intention is for this book to be kept up to date by
its user community. However, for the very latest information
on IPv6 operational best practices and protocol details,
readers may wish to track the discussions in the relevant
IETF working groups, in particular
[IPv6 Operations (v6ops)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/v6ops/about/)
and
[IPv6 Maintenance (6man)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/6man/about/).
These groups are open to all, although following the discussion can
be quite time-consuming.

The final results of these working groups are published as Internet
Request for Comments documents (RFCs), freely available from
the [RFC Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org/). *Warning:* obsolete
RFCs are never modified or deleted. It is essential to look at
the current status of an RFC before trusting it. For example,
the current status of the 2017 version of the main IPv6 standard is shown
at [this info page](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8200).

This book intends to cite the latest version of all the RFCs it
mentions, but it never hurts to check the info page.

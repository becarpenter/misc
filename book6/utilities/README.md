# README for book6/utilities

This directory contains a few items that are not part of the book itself but are useful anyway.

In particular there's makeBook.py, whose job is to reconcile book6 chapters with contents, and set up inter-section and inter-chapter links as far as possible. Please don't run it unless you know what you're doing.

# book6
A collaborative IPv6 book.

The intention is a practical introduction to IPv6 for technical people, kept up to date by active practitioners.

The book will be available free of charge (and free of advertising) on-line, possibly with an option to obtain a printed copy at cost price.

This GitHub repository is a starting point. It may be replaced by a differently structured repo as the work progresses and we gain experience of how to do it.

## How a network operations center sees IPv6

This is really the topic of this entire book. In the long term,
we expect that "running an IPv6 network" will be synonymous with
"running a network". IPv6 should not be viewed as an add-on,
but as the primary network protocol. How it coexists and
interacts with IPv4 is the subject of [Chapter 3](https://github.com/becarpenter/book6/tree/main/3.%20Coexistence%20with%20legacy%20IPv4). This
section gives an overview of how IPv6 looks when viewed from
the NOC, and the rest of the book covers the details.

Much more, to be drafted by someone who actually runs a NOC...

## Packet Format

IPv6 packets are transmitted independently of each other even if they belong to the same application session, so they are sometimes referred to as *datagrams*. The basic datagram header is as follows. (The diagram is 32 bits wide
and big-endian.)

(Followed immediately by one or more "next headers" including the
upper layer payload.)

Some notes on these fixed fields:

- Version: is always 6

- Traffic class: six bits of [differentiated services](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2474) code point followed by two [ECN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3168) bits.

- Flow label: 20 bits. Should be a pseudo-random value unique to a given traffic flow. See [IPv6 Flow Label Specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6437), [Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Equal Cost Multipath Routing and Link Aggregation in Tunnels](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6438) and [Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Load Balancing in Server Farms](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7098).

- Payload length: Length of the rest of the packet following this IPv6 header, counted in bytes.

- Next header: an integer defining the type of the following header.

- Hop limit: counts down at each routing hop. Packet discarded when it hits zero.

- Addresses: 128 bits; see below.

The "next headers" are an important aspect of the design. After the fixed header just defined, there are one or more additional headers chained together. The best description is probably in [the standard itself](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8200), so we only give a summary here. Every header format has a known length, and includes a "next header" field identifying the next header (d'oh). The last header in a packet is usually a TCP or UDP header containing the actual payload. The last header naturally has a "next header" field, but it contains the magic number 59, which means "no next header", and terminates the chain.

The earlier headers have functions including:

- Hop-by-hop options, for packet-level options that should be examined by every node on the path.

- Fragment header, when a packet has been fragmented (which happens only at the source, if the raw packet exceeds the IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 bytes).

- Destination options, for packet-level options only useful at the destination node.

- Routing header, if non-standard routing is required.

- Encapsulating security payload, if [IPsec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4303) is in use.

An interesting feature of IPv6 is that extension header types are numbered out of the same space as IP protocol numbers. It isn't a coincidence that the next header type for UDP is 17, the same as IPPROTO_UDP; it's by design. The latest set of valid extension header types is always available from [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters/ipv6-parameters.xhtml).

Extension headers and options are described in more detail in the section [Extension headers and options](Extension-headers-and-options.md). It's also worth noting that Wireshark knows all about IPv6 header formats.

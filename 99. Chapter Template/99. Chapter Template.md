# 99. Chapter Template

This is the general intro for a chapter. Tell the reader what the chapter is all about. Then give a list of the sections, with pointers to the individual section files. It would be possible to embed the sections right here, but maintenance by multiple authors will be easier with a separate file per section.

Important: Markdown can't handle file names with spaces in them. You need to replace spaces with \%20, or avoid spaces in the file names. Also, filenames are case-sensitive. Apart from that, it's nice to use the same name for the section and its file, as long as the name isn't too long. So here is the template for the list of sections:

## [First Section](First%20Section.md)
## [Another Section](Another%20Section.md)
## [Last Section](Last%20Section.md)

### [<ins>Back to main Contents</ins>](../Contents.md)

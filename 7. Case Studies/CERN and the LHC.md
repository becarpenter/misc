## CERN and the LHC

The [CERN laboratory](https://www.cern.ch) and the
[Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)](https://home.cern/science/computing/grid)
are large users of IPv6 for massive data transfers. Some recent
statistics are shown here:

The CERN site itself operates a classical IPv4 and IPv6 dual stack, and
uses DHCPv6 for IPv6 address assignment.

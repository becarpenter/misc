# whenmail

Some plots of when IETFers send email, on an hourly or daily basis. These plots cover three MBOX files on separate topics: differentiated services, IPv6 in general, and IPv6 deployment issues. There are plots for the senders' local time zone and for UTC in each case.

No emails that I personally** sent were counted, and only emails where the string "ietf" (or "IETF") appears in the To: or Cc: (or CC:) fields were counted.

The code is here but there is no warranty of any kind; do what you want with it at your own risk.

** or anyone else called Brian, for reasons of lazy programming.

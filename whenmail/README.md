# whenmail

Some plots of when IETFers send email, on an hourly or daily basis. These plots cover three MBOX files on separate topics: differentiated services, IPv6 in general, and IPv6 deployment issues. There are plots for the senders' local time zone and for UTC in each case.

This doesn't cover *all* email; it covers all the email I happen to have kept on these topics. The code should work on any MBOX-format file.

No emails that I personally** sent were counted, and only emails where the string "ietf" (or "IETF") appears in the To: or Cc: (or CC:) fields were counted.

The code isn't quite ready for public view yet.

** or anyone else called Brian, for reasons of lazy programming.

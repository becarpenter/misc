# xtract-svg

A crude Python program to extract SVG files from an RFC in modern HTML format. The HTML file must be on your local disk - no support for remote files. It puts the files in a separate directory named like rfc9876-figs.

License is "do whatever you want with it". Rough and ready code, run entirely at your own risk. Uses Tkinter, so it ought to work on most Python 3 implementations. Only tested on Windows 10.
